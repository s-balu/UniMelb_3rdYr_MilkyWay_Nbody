# *N-body Simulations: Dark Matter Halo*

### Laboratory and Computational Physics 3, University of Melbourne

This repo holds the code and data for the computational lab of the course "Laboratory and Computational Physics 3" at the University of Melbourne.

Students work on this lab for 18 hours over two weeks in rotating groups. The latest version of the lab notes can be found at [here.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/8lrvhre5uyx3ebdlnytgz/AANh2dm2zVmM8ZvmPupf528?e=1&preview=UniMelb_gal_DM_notes.pdf&rlkey=uvxmbmuynxq4zvrqpb8p3gxws&st=4pxr95g9&dl=0)

I also thank Pedro Rossell√≥. The implementation here borrows heavily from his *N*-body [code](https://github.com/pererossello/galaxy_with_DM_halo).
